##### (I am currently writing this while sneaking in a physics lecture about rotational energy.)

## Welcome To Nora Oken's Official Blog!

This is the first step towards our journey together. 

Allow me to introduce myself. I promise I'll keep it short and sweet :)

My name is Brian Nguyen. I am a freshman at The Ohio State University and pre-majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. The purpose of this blog is to serve as a living document of my learning experiences as well as projects in development. Along the way, I'll also share my thoughts about the daily s̶t̶r̶u̶g̶g̶l̶e̶s̶  occurences as a Computer Science student. 

This is what you can expect:

* Initial concepts and ideas
* Computer Science facts and tidbits
* Aha/breakthrough moments !!
* Doodles (and occasional illustrations)
* Random thoughts and ramblings

The blog is still in its early developmental stages. I just wanted to start uploading content and will continue to update the design and layout. Thanks for viewing :)
