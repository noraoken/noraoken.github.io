When developing locally (left), the landing page is exactly how I intended (the current title image is an illustration by the talented Jie Finch but will be replaced with an original illustration). For some reason, the URL appeared smack dab in the middle of the title image when the blog was pushed to Github (right). I've looked over the code and even consulted the knowledgable Reddit discussion boards, but to no avail...

I will slash this bug if it's the last thing I do <(  `^')>

##### In Development: title logo design

#### edit: images on public server and post archive not showing
