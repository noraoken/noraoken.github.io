While my social life is pretty close to non-existent so far, I have made an effort to be involved in events and oppurtunities that I believe are supportive of the development of my career. I wanted to provide a brief overview of these moments and what I took away from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;08/19: Involvement Fair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was able to find and join the Game Creation Club and recieved a lego Android kit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;08/28: First Game Creation Club Meeting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;09/06: How to get an Internship at Facebook with Wally Yang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;09/26: Engineering Expo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With 10 copies of my resume that I completed and printed earlier that day, I attended the Engineering Expo at the Ohio Union. I was shocked to see companies such as Amazon and Facebook with their long lines of applicants. Even though I was dressed to impress, I didn’t exude the confidence that I wished I had when I talked to my first company, Upstart. I was geniuely interested in what their company was about and listened as they answered my partly stuttered questions. However, they weren’t accepting internships. Feeling too unconfident to talk to another company, I left without handing out a single copy of my resume. But I left with an Upstart logo sticker and socks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;09/27: Fall Game Jam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After completing physics homework for the night, I stopped by Enarson Hall to participate in the Fall Game Jam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing locally (left), the landing page is exactly how I intended (the current title image is an illustration by the talented Jie Finch but will be replaced with an original illustration). For some reason, the URL appeared smack dab in the middle of the title image when the blog was pushed to Github (right). I’ve looked over the code and even consulted the knowledgable Reddit discussion boards, but to no avail…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will slash this bug if it’s the last thing I do &amp;lt;(  `^’)&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;welcome-to-nora-okens-official-blog&quot;&gt;Welcome To Nora Oken’s Official Blog!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first step towards our journey together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to introduce myself. I promise I’ll keep it short and sweet :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Brian Nguyen. I am a freshman at The Ohio State University and pre-majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. The purpose of this blog is to serve as a living document of my learning experiences as well as projects in development. Along the way, I’ll also share my thoughts about the daily s̶t̶r̶u̶g̶g̶l̶e̶s̶  occurences as a Computer Science student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what you can expect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initial concepts and ideas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer Science facts and tidbits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aha/breakthrough moments !!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doodles (and occasional illustrations)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Random thoughts and ramblings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog is still in its early developmental stages. I just wanted to start uploading content and will continue to update the design and layout. Thanks for viewing :)&lt;/p&gt;
